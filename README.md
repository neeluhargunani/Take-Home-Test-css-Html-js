header and navigation had been created using flex approach with responsive naveigation by toggle function 
2nd step section had been created using image with positions properties and overlay on image with content in center 
3rd flex box had been usde by me 
footer is simple with 100px and navigation header too 100px 
image is not set in css but taken by html image tag only css styles had been applied in css 

The complete image is optimized with all device comparision 
I had taken flex approacg because using flex properties we can easily create the allignments without using heavy codes of margin , padding etc 
flex deiractiosn also declare the rows and colums easily we can identify ,
positions is taken to overlap the contents and button
click me button is alert box usde inline scripting by onclick event the alert box apperad says "hello world" 
Thsi take home test was intresting and enjoyed alot while doinf in pure css with no bs framework and image too in html with all devise checked responsiveness
